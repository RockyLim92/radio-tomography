This radio tomography project is as study conducted at CSIRO Australia.
the purpose of this project is developing radio tomography system by using low power sensor network device.
For this, I used TI Sensortasg cc2650 as a low power device. and I used
Contiki-OS for device application OS for radio tomography system.
There are two major steps for Developing Radio Tomography using low power network device.
One is to develop the device application that I use, TI Sensortag, and other is reconstructing image form data that collected by using network devices.
