This example code is for radio tomography application.

Befor you set up a radio tomography network, you have to make sure about node configuration.

In node_config.h file, there are some parameters for this system.

you have to change node configuration and progrmam it to each nodes becasue every nodes have different node id.

each configuration parameters of nodes in the same network should have same parameter value except THIS_NODE_NUM(node id)
