This example code is for master node in radio tomography application.

Befor you set up a radio tomography network, you have to make sure about node configuration.

In node_config.h file, there are some parameters for this system.

each configuration parameters of master node should have same parameter of other nodes in the samse network

You don't need to take care of THIS_NODE_NUM(node id) in master node.
