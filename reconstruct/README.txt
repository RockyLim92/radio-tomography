To reconstruct image and play it as stream, you need raw data file, covariance matrix, and weight matrix. all of these need to be saved at the same directory as a text file and name as "test.txt", "covarianceMatrix.txt", "weightMatrix.txt". you can get each file by using each python code, "serial.py" for raw data file, "matrix.py" of covariance matrix and weight matrix.
